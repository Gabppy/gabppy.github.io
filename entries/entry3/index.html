 <h2>How To Make Friends?</h2>
 <p1>Be yourself and be initiative! 
        <br>
        Although you might be comfortable by spending time with yourself and be alone, sometimes it is reasonable for people to want to make friends.
        If you are manifesting for a great friend, a life friend, it is important to really search for them!
        Going out there and be initiative so that you can make your "vibe check" with more people. Just like dating!
        I know that it is hard to be initiative, especially if you are trying to make friends with people who has almost extremely different culture with you, but here are some of the tips that I find helpful!</p1>

<h2>Find Yourself And Truly Be Interested In Other People</h2>
<p2>A great friend, even a life friend, will stay close with you only through your similarities shared between you guys and your attraction to them.
        You can't make a friend if you know nothing about them. You want to find someone who you might relate to and even have shared hobbies so that you don't have to bend your rules to keep a friendship.
        To sincerely find friends, start with finding what they love and what you love. It is hard to find similarities with people if you don't think you know yourself. 
        Write down what you think you enjoy doing and what you hate in life can be something really helpful to do! I asked if my friends would like to be my model for my photography class and they happily accepted it!

<h2>To learn to spend quality time with yourself and others can be a life long journey. 
        My wellness counselor said that meditating, journaling and gratitudes can effectively boost people's mental health. 
        Please be kind to yourself and take great care of yourself! Be hopeful and make wonderful friends!</h2><br><br>
