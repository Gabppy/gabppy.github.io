        Photography diary:
        Finally feel the feeling of taking a big step forward into photography this week! 
        I still remember how inconsistent of the quality of my photography works was at the first 2 tries. 
        11/11 was my third attempt of shooting in a studio with a model. With the help of David, my prof of the class, I finally can better control my lighting and incorporate with more photography tools. 
        The science behind photography is always intriguing and fascinating to see and learn. 
        The continuous lighting techniques, the flash devices, the strobe, the camera remote thingy that controls the shutter to open and give multiple exposure to pictures. 
        Oh I used the effect gel kits this time! 
        I want to use something else next time to create the colorful shadows and I want to make short little films for Michelson!! 
        We are now really planning to try to build a fan base now on social medias. Itâ€™s just A LOT of works and A LOT of balance to find. 
        Maybe I should switch to photography major! but I do enjoy the process of learning to arrange types to better convey an idea as well. 
        Guess it is going to be on the fate now! 
        
        PS: It is really hard to work with Lightroom!! I will definitely do more editing on my phone rather than in Lightroom hahaha
