Welcome to my first recommendation of my fav meditation videos!

This video from Youtube is a morning meditation for positive energy. My review for this video is 9.5/10, 0.5 minused for the chennel because they sometimes put ads at the end of their videos. Really is a jump scare for me and you will never know if the next video you click has an ad at the end since it is from youtube.




Volume of sounds in my head while listening to this meditation video:
