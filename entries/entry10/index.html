<h1>Personal Story</h1>
<p>
      Six years ago, at the tender age of 13, I embarked on a journey that would redefine the course of my life.
leaving my homeland in China, I arrived in the United States feeling curious and hopeful. Little did I know that 
this leap into the unknown would not only shape my academic future but also pave the way for a blossoming career
in the world of R&B music. BA-BAM!<br><br>
      Even if it was SoO hard for anyone to acclimate to a whole different world with a whole different culture 
and even culturesS, I stumbled upon a medium that transcended language â€“ music (well, always love it since a
kid but actually KNOW it now). R&B became my solace, a universal language that spoke to the depths of my 
emotions. Inspired by the likes of legends such as Khalil Fong and contemporary artists like Justin Bieber, 
I discovered an innate talent for music production, songwriting, and singing. The melodies I crafted became
a form of self-expression, a bridge between my past and present, and a means to connect with others. Really, 
to spread Love, yo! (shout outs to Jessi Pinkman, y'all)<br><br>
      After I finally made it out of highschool, moving to New York as a NYU student really helped me getting closer
to all of the talented ones. I mean, it REALLY did!! Meeting people with probably the most promising futures who
are dedicating to build their skills made me my very first music video, Openrelationship, 2023. Really thankful
for all of us to gathered and made all of our dreams come ture. It could be so so much harder without them. Y'all
brought so many colors to my life~~ Love all of you!!<3<3<3
